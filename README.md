# Mostly Adequate - Gitbook Review

## Source Material

[Professor Frisby's Mostly Adequate Guide to Functional Programming](https://mostly-adequate.gitbooks.io/mostly-adequate-guide/content/)

## Overview

Examples are generally provided as one or more libraries of functions.
An accompanying set of one or more test files is provided to demonstrate their use in practice.

## Chapters

### Chapter 01 - Introduction

This chapter includes a *Brief Encounter* with the first examples.
These examples demonstrate mathematical properties of functions.

Review examples are in [`src/chapter01`](https://github.com/SHaTRO/mostly-adequate/tree/main/src/chapter01).
The math property assertions are demonstrated by examples in the [`mathstuff.test.ts`](https://github.com/SHaTRO/mostly-adequate/tree/main/src/chapter01/mathstuff.test.ts) file.
Note that the *commutative* property is not *associative*.
